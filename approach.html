    <h1>My Therapeutic Approach</h1>

    <p>
        I work with adults navigating trauma, anxiety, emotional overwhelm, relationship patterns, 
        self-worth, and life transitions. Therapy with me is collaborative and grounded in curiosity—your 
        experiences and inner world guide the process.
    </p>

    <h2>Modalities I Integrate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Client-Centered Therapy</strong> — a warm, validating space centered on you.</li>
        <li><strong>EMDR</strong> — processing trauma and stuck memories to restore balance.</li>
        <li><strong>IFS-Informed Therapy</strong> — understanding parts of self with compassion.</li>
        <li><strong>DBT Skills</strong> — grounding, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Attachment-Based Approaches</strong> — exploring relational patterns and needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma-Focused CBT</strong> — structured support to shift unhelpful beliefs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Therapy Feels Like</h2>
    <p>
        Sessions are gentle, thoughtful, and paced with care. We focus not only on challenges 
        but also on resilience, agency, and the deeper roots of your emotional experiences.
