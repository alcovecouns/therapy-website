    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="me.jpg" alt="Kim Wood LMHC" class="about-photo">

    <p>
        I’m <strong>Kim (Kimberly) Wood, LMHC</strong>, a licensed mental health counselor in Florida. 
        My work is grounded in compassion, curiosity, and the belief that every person deserves 
        a space where they can feel seen, understood, and safe.
    </p>

    <p>
        I bring a warm, steady, and client-centered presence to therapy, integrating 
        approaches like EMDR, IFS-informed parts work, DBT skills, attachment theory, 
        and trauma-focused CBT. My goal is to support you in healing patterns that no longer 
        serve you and rediscovering your inner wisdom.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of therapy, I’m someone who values quiet moments, meaningful conversations, 
        and the process of ongoing personal growth.
